The main advantage of scRNA-seq is that the cellular resolution and the genome wide scope makes it possible to address issues that are intractable using other methods, e.g. bulk RNA-seq or single-cell RT-qPCR. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will be surveying the existing problems as well as the available computational and statistical frameworks available for the analysis of scRNA-seq. The course is taught through the University of Cambridge Bioinformatics training unit, but the material found on these pages is meant to be used for anyone interested in learning about computational analysis of scRNA-seq data. If you have any comments or suggestions about the material, please do not hesitate to contact (add link!) us.  1.1 Registration http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/1755391   1.2 GitHub https://github.com/hemberg-lab/scRNA.seq.course   1.3 License Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License   1.4 Prerequisites The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix and the R scripting language.

Datasets range from \\(10^2\\) to \\(10^4\\) cells and increase in size every year Currently there are several different protocols in use, e.g. SMART-seq2 (Picelli et al. 2013), CELL-seq (Hashimshony et al. 2012) and Drop-seq (Macosko et al. 2015) Several computational analysis methods from bulk RNA-seq can be used In most cases computational analysis requires adaptation of the existing methods or development of new ones    3.3 Protocol    Figure 3.1: Single cell sequencing (taken from here)   Overall, experimental scRNA-seq protocols are similar to the methods used for bulk RNA-seq. For a discussion on experimental methods, please see reviews by (Saliba et al. 2014), (Handley et al. 2015) or (Kolodziejczyk et al. 2015).   3.4 Computational Analysis This course is concerned with the computational analysis of the data obtained from scRNA-seq experiments. The first steps (yellow) are general for any highthroughput sequencing data. Later steps (orange) require a mix of existing RNASeq analysis methods and novel methods to address the technical difference of scRNASeq. Finally the biological interpretation should be analyzed with methods specifically developed for scRNASeq.    Figure 3.2: Flowchart of the scRNA-seq analysis   There are several reviews of the scRNA-seq analysis available including (Stegle, Teichmann, and Marioni 2015).   3.5 Challenges The main difference between bulk and single cell RNA-seq is that each sequencing library represents a single cell, instead of a population of cells. Therefore, significant attention has to be paid to comparison of the results from different cells (sequencing libraries). The main sources of discrepancy between the libraries are:  Amplification (up to 1 million fold) Gene ‘dropouts’ in which a gene is observed at a moderate expression level in one cell but is not detected in another cell (Kharchenko, Silberstein, and Scadden 2014).  In both cases the discrepancies are introduced due to low starting amounts of transcripts since the RNA comes from one cell only. Improving the transcript capture efficiency and reducing the amplification bias are currently active areas of research.   3.6 Controls To provide better estimates of the technical variation between scRNA sequencing libraries two quantitative standards are frequently used. The aim of using spike-ins and UMIs is to facilitate normalization of gene expression levels across different cells.  3.6.1 Spike-ins Spike-ins are extrinsic RNA molecules of known concentration which are added to the lysate of each cell prior to the reverse transcription reaction. The most popular and widely used spike-ins are synthetic spikes from the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC). This set of 96 synthetic mRNAs of differing length and GC content based on bacterial sequences (Jiang et al. 2011).   3.6.2 UMIs Another method of standardisation is to use Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) (Kivioja et al. 2012). These are 4-20 bp barcode sequences which are added to the 3’ or 5’ end of each transcript prior to amplification (typically during reverse transcription). This is usually followed by targetted sequencing of the respective end of the transcripts. The barcodes make it possible to quantify the number of transcripts prior to the amplification step.    "],

The first step is to ensure that the reads are of high quality. The quality control can be performed by using standard tools, such as FastQC or Kraken. Assuming that our reads are in experiment.bam, we run FastQC as $&lt;path_to_fastQC&gt;/fastQC experiment.bam Below is an example of the output from FastQC for a dataset of 125 bp reads. The plot reveals a technical error which resulted in a couple bases failing to be read correctly in the centre of the read. However, since the rest of the read was of high quality this error will most likely have a negligible effect on mapping efficiency.    Figure 4.1: Example of FastQC output   Additionally, it is often helpful to visualize the data using the Integrative Genomics Browser (IGV) or SeqMonk.   4.2 Reads alignment After trimming low quality bases from the reads, the remaining sequences can be mapped to a reference genome. Again, there is no need for a special purpose method for this, so we can use the STAR or the TopHat aligner. An example of how to map reads.bam to using STAR is $&lt;path_to_STAR&gt;/STAR --runThreadN 1 --runMode alignReads --readFilesIn reads1.fq.gz reads2.fq.gz --readFilesCommand zcat --genomeDir &lt;path&gt; --parametersFiles FileOfMoreParameters.txt --outFileNamePrefix &lt;outpath&gt;/output Note, if the spike-ins are used, the reference sequence should be augmented with the DNA sequence of the spike-in molecules prior to mapping. Note, when UMIs are used, their barcodes should be removed from the read sequence. A common practice is to add the barcode to the read name. Once the reads for each cell have been mapped to the reference genome, we need to make sure that a sufficient number of reads from each cell could be mapped to the reference genome. In our experience, the fraction of mappable reads for mouse or human cells is 60-70%. However, this result may vary depending on protocol, read length and settings for the read alignment. As a general rule, we expect all cells to have a similar fraction of mapped reads, so any outliers should be inspected and possibly removed. A low proportion of mappable reads usually indicates contamination.   4.3 Alignment example The histogram below shows the total number of reads mapped to each cell for an scRNA-seq experiment. Each bar represents one cell, and they have been sorted in ascending order by the total number of reads per cell. The three red arrows indicate cells that are outliers in terms of their coverage and they should be removed from further analysis. The two yellow arrows point to cells with a surprisingly large number of unmapped reads. In this example we kept the cells during the alignment QC step, but they were later removed during cell QC due to a high proportion of ribosomal RNA reads.    Figure 4.2: Example of the total number of reads mapped to each cell.     4.4 Mapping QC After mapping the raw sequencing to the genome we need to evaluate the quality of the mapping. There are many ways to measure the mapping quality, including: amount of reads mapping to rRNA/tRNAs, proportion of uniquely mapping reads, reads mapping across splice junctions, read depth along the transcripts. Methods developed for bulk RNA-seq, such as RSeQC, are applicable to single-cell data: python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/geneBody_coverage.py -i input.bam -r genome.bed -o output.txt python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/bam_stat.py -i input.bam -r genome.bed -o output.txt python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/split_bam.py -i input.bam -r rRNAmask.bed -o output.txt However the expected results will depend on the experimental protocol, e.g. many scRNA-seq methods use poly-A selection to avoid sequencing rRNAs which results in a 3’ bias in the read coverage across the genes (aka gene body coverage). The figure below shows this 3’ bias as well as three cells which were outliers and removed from the dataset:    Figure 4.3: Example of the 3’ bias in the read coverage.     4.5 Reads quantification The next step is to quantify the expression level of each gene for each cell. For mRNA data, we can use one of the tools which has been developed for bulk RNA-seq data, e.g. HT-seq or FeatureCounts # include multimapping &lt;featureCounts_path&gt;/featureCounts -O -M -Q 30 -p -a genome.gtf -o outputfile input.bam # exclude multimapping &lt;featureCounts_path&gt;/featureCounts -Q 30 -p -a genome.gtf -o outputfile input.bam  4.5.1 UMI quantification The number of unique barcodes used as UMIs is typically much smaller than the total number of mRNAs in a cell. Thus to properly count UMIs they must be separated into groups based on their mapping position. Most scRNASeq methods perform several rounds of PCR prior to fragmenting transcripts. As a result UMIs originating from the same mRNA won’t map to exactly the same position in the genome. Thus UMIs should be grouped by transcript or gene. One way to achieve this is to map reads to the transcriptome rather than the genome. Once UMIs have been grouped the number of original mRNA molecules can be estimated by counting the number of unique UMIs in each group. However, single base-pair substitutions introduced by errors during PCR or sequencing can create “new” unique UMIs inflating the counts. This effect depends on the length of the barcode used, longer = more potential errors. For instance using a 10bp barcode will result in ~7% of reads containing at least one error. To our knowledge the only software which attempts to correct for these errors is UMI-tools. They provide several different methods to quantify UMIs based on different assumptions about what type of errors occur in the barcodes (they discuss them in detail here).    "],

The package contains several useful methods for quality control, visualisation and pre-processing of data prior to further downstream analysis. scater features the following functionality:  Automated computation of QC metrics Transcript quantification from read data with pseudo-alignment Data format standardisation Rich visualizations for exploratory analysis Seamless integration into the Bioconductor universe Simple normalisation methods  We highly recommend to use scater for all single-cell RNA-seq analyses and scater is the basis of the first part of the course.   5.2 scater workflow       5.3 Terminology (this chapter is taken from the scater vignette)  The capabilities of scater are built on top of Bioconductor’s Biobase. In Bioconductor terminology we assay numerous “features” for a number of “samples”. Features, in the context of scater, correspond most commonly to genes or transcripts, but could be any general genomic or transcriptomic regions (e.g. exon) of interest for which we take measurements. In the following chapters it may be more intuitive to mentally replace “feature” with “gene” or “transcript” (depending on the context of the study) wherever “feature” appears. In the scater context, “samples” refer to individual cells that we have assayed.    5.4 SCESet class (this chapter is taken from the scater vignette) In scater we organise single-cell expression data in objects of the SCESet class. The class inherits the Bioconductor ExpressionSet class, which provides a common interface familiar to those who have analyzed microarray experiments with Bioconductor. The class requires three input files:  exprs, a numeric matrix of expression values, where rows are features, and columns are cells phenoData, an AnnotatedDataFrame object, where rows are cells, and columns are cell attributes (such as cell type, culture condition, day captured, etc.) featureData, an AnnotatedDataFrame object, where rows are features (e.g. genes), and columns are feature attributes, such as biotype, gc content, etc.  For more details about other features inherited from Bioconductor’s ExpressionSet class, type ?ExpressionSet at the R prompt. When the data are encapsulated in the SCESet class, scater will automatically calculate several different properties. This will be demonstrated in the subsequent chapters.   "],

This matrix should be examined to remove poor quality cells which were not detected in either read QC or mapping QC steps. Failure to remove low quality cells at this stage may add technical noise which has the potential to obscure the biological signals of interest in the downstream analysis. Since there is currently no standard method for performing scRNASeq the expected values for the various QC measures that will be presented here can vary substantially from experiment to experiment. Thus, to perform QC we will be looking for cells which are outliers with respect to the rest of the dataset rather than comparing to independent quality standards. Consequently, care should be taken when comparing quality metrics across datasets collected using different protocols.   6.2 Blischak dataset To illustrate cell QC, we consider a dataset of induced pluripotent stem cells generated from three different individuals by John Blischak in Yoav Gilad’s lab at the University of Chicago. The experiments were carried out on the Fluidigm C1 platform and to facilitate the quantification both unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and ERCC spike-ins were used. For our purposes you need to download the files annotation.txt, molecules.txt, and reads.txt into the blischak folder in your working directory.

Wells with few reads/molecules are likely to have been broken or failed to capture a cell, and should thus be removed. hist(     umi$total_counts,     breaks = 100 ) abline(v = 25000, col = &quot;red&quot;)    Figure 6.1: Histogram of library sizes for all cells   Exercise 1  How many cells does our filter remove? What distribution do you expect that the total number of molecules for each cell should follow?  Our answer  Table 6.3: The number of cells removed by total counts filter (FALSE)   filter_by_total_counts Freq     FALSE 46   TRUE 818    If your answer is different please compare your code with ours (you need to search for this exercise in the opened file).   6.3.2 Detected genes (1) In addition to ensuring sufficient sequencing depth for each sample, we also want to make sure that the reads are distributed across the transcriptome. Thus, we count the total number of unique genes detected in each sample. hist(     umi$total_features,     breaks = 100 ) abline(v = 7000, col = &quot;red&quot;)    Figure 6.2: Histogram of the number of detected genes in all cells   From the plot we conclude that most cells have between 7,000-10,000 detected genes, which is normal for high-depth scRNA-seq. However, this varies by experimental protocol and sequencing depth. For example, droplet-based methods or samples with lower sequencing-depth typically detect fewer genes per cell. The most notable feature in the above plot is the “heavy tail” on the left hand side of the distribution. If detection rates were equal across the cells then the distribution should be approximately normal. Thus we remove those cells in the tail of the distribution (fewer than 7,000 detected genes). Exercise 2 How many cells does our filter remove? Our answer  Table 6.4: The number of cells removed by total features filter (FALSE)   filter_by_expr_features Freq     FALSE 120   TRUE 744    If your answer is different please compare your code with ours (you need to search for this exercise in the opened file).   6.3.3 ERCCs and MTs Another measure of cell quality is the ratio between ERCC spike-in RNAs and endogenous RNAs. This ratio can be used to estimate the total amount of RNA in the captured cells. Cells with a high level of spike-in RNAs had low starting amounts of RNA, likely due to the cell being dead or stressed which may result in the RNA being degraded. scater::plotPhenoData(     umi,     aes_string(x = &quot;total_features&quot;,                y = &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_MT&quot;,                colour = &quot;batch&quot;) )    Figure 6.3: Percentage of counts in MT genes   scater::plotPhenoData(     umi,     aes_string(x = &quot;total_features&quot;,                y = &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_ERCC&quot;,                colour = &quot;batch&quot;) )    Figure 6.4: Percentage of counts in ERCCs   The above analysis shows that majority of the cells from NA19098.r2 batch have a very high ERCC/Endo ratio. Indeed, it has been shown by the authors that this batch contains cells of smaller size. Exercise 3 Create filters for removing batch NA19098.r2 and cells with high expression of mitochondrial genes (&gt;10% of total counts in a cell). Our answer  Table 6.5: The number of cells removed by ERCC filter (FALSE)   filter_by_ERCC Freq     FALSE 96   TRUE 768     Table 6.6: The number of cells removed by MT filter (FALSE)   filter_by_MT Freq     FALSE 31   TRUE 833    If your answer is different please compare your code with ours (you need to search for this exercise in the opened file). Exercise 4 What would you expect to see in the ERCC vs counts plot if you were examining a dataset containing cells of different sizes (eg. normal &amp; senescent cells)? Answer You would expect to see a group corresponding to the smaller cells (normal) with a higher fraction of ERCC reads than a separate group corresponding to the larger cells (senescent).    6.4 Cell filtering  6.4.1 Default Thresholds Results from the biological analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data are often strongly influenced by outliers. Thus, it is important to include multiple filters. A robust way of detecting outliers is through the median absolute difference which is defined as \\(d_i = |r_i - m|\\), where \\(r_i\\) is the number of reads in cell \\(i\\) and \\(m\\) is the median number of reads across the all cells in the sample. By default, scater removes all cells where \\(d_i&gt;\\)median(\\(d_i\\)). A similar filter is used for the number of detected genes. Furthermore, scater removes all cells where $&gt;$80% of counts were assigned to control genes and any cells that have been marked as controls. umi$use_default &lt;- (     # remove cells with unusual numbers of genes     !umi$filter_on_total_features &amp;     # remove cells with unusual numbers molecules counted     !umi$filter_on_total_counts &amp;     # &lt; 80% ERCC spike-in     !umi$filter_on_pct_counts_feature_controls_ERCC &amp;     # &lt; 80% mitochondrial     !umi$filter_on_pct_counts_feature_controls_MT &amp;     # controls shouldn&#39;t be used in downstream analysis     !umi$is_cell_control ) knitr::kable(   as.data.frame(table(umi$use_default)),   booktabs = TRUE,   row.names = FALSE,   caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by default filter (FALSE)&#39; )  Table 6.7: The number of cells removed by default filter (FALSE)   Var1 Freq     FALSE 6   TRUE 858      6.4.2 Automatic Another option available in scater is to conduct PCA on a set of QC metrics and then use automatic outlier detection to identify potentially problematic cells. By default, the following metrics are used for PCA-based outlier detection:  pct_counts_top_100_features total_features pct_counts_feature_controls n_detected_feature_controls log10_counts_endogenous_features log10_counts_feature_controls  scater first creates a matrix where the rows represent cells and the columns represent the different QC metrics. Here, the PCA plot provides a 2D representation of cells ordered by their quality metrics.

Moreover, inspection of the gene expression profiles may provide insights about how the experimental procedures could be imporved. It is often instructive to consider the number of reads consumed by the top 50 expressed genes. scater::plotQC(umi, type = &quot;highest-expression&quot;)    Figure 6.7: Number of total counts consumed by the top 50 expressed genes   The distribution relatively flat indicating (but not guaraneeing!) good coverage of the full transcriptome of these cells. However, there are several spike-ins in the top 15 genes which suggests a greater dilution of the spike-ins may be preferrable if the experiment is to be repeated.   6.6.2 Gene filtering It is typically a good idea to remove genes whose expression level is considered “undetectable”. We define a gene as detectable if at least two cells contain more than 1 transcript from the gene. If we were considering read counts rather than UMI counts a reasonable threshold is to require at least five reads in at least two cells. However, in both cases the threshold strongly depends on the sequencing depth. It also important to keep in mind that genes must be filtered after cell filtering since some genes may be only detected in poor quality cells. filter_genes &lt;- apply(counts(umi), 1, function(x) length(x[x &gt; 1]) &gt;= 2) fData(umi)$use &lt;- filter_genes knitr::kable(     as.data.frame(table(filter_genes)),     booktabs = TRUE,     row.names = FALSE,     caption = &#39;The number of genes removed by gene filter (FALSE)&#39; )  Table 6.10: The number of genes removed by gene filter (FALSE)   filter_genes Freq     FALSE 4512   TRUE 14214    Depending on the cell-type, protocol and sequencing depth, other cut-offs may be appropriate.    6.7 Save the data Dimensions of the QCed dataset (do not forget about the gene filter we defined above): dim(umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use]) ## Features  Samples  ##    14214      654 Save the data: saveRDS(umi, file = &quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) If you want to further check yourself you can download our umi object.

["data-visualization.html", "8 Data visualization 8.1 Introduction 8.2 PCA plot 8.3 tSNE map 8.4 Big Exercise", " 8 Data visualization  8.1 Introduction In this chapter we will continue to work with the filtered blischak dataset produced in the previous chapter. We will explore different ways of visualizing the data to allow you to asses what happened to the expression matrix after the quality control step. One important aspect of single-cell RNA-seq is to control for batch effects. Batch effects are technical artefacts that are added to the samples during handling. For example, if two sets of samples were prepared in different labs or even on different days in the same lab, then we may observe greater similarities between the samples that were handled together. In the worst case scenario, batch effects may be mistaken for true biological variation. The Blischak data allows us to explore these issues in a controlled manner since some of the salient aspects of how the samples were handled have been recorded. Ideally, we expect to see batches from the same individual grouping together and distinct groups corresponding to each individual. library(scater, quietly = TRUE) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] # after QC we could get some genes with only 0 values # we need to remove those keep_feature &lt;- rowSums(is_exprs(umi.qc)) &gt; 0 umi.qc &lt;- umi.qc[keep_feature, ] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control   8.2 PCA plot The easiest thing to overview the data is to transform it using the principal component analysis and then visualize the first two principal components. Again the scater package provides several very useful functions to make this analysis straightforward.  8.2.1 Before QC scater::plotPCA(umi[endog_genes, ],                 ntop = 500,                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;)    Figure 8.1: PCA plot of the blischak data     8.2.2 After QC scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                 ntop = 500,                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;)    Figure 8.2: PCA plot of the blischak data   Comparing Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2, it is clear that after normalization the NA19098.r2 cells no longer form a group of outliers. By default only the top 500 most variable genes are used by scater to calculate the PCA. This can be adjusted by changing the ntop argument. Exercise 1 How do the PCA plots change if when all 14,214 genes are used? Or when only top 50 genes are used? Our answer    Figure 8.3: PCA plot of the blischak data (14214 genes)      Figure 8.4: PCA plot of the blischak data (50 genes)   If your answers are different please compare your code with ours (you need to search for this exercise in the opened file).    8.3 tSNE map An alternative to PCA for visualizing scRNASeq data is a tSNE plot. tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) combines dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) with random walks on the nearest-neighbour network to map high dimensional data (i.e. our 14,214 dimensional expression matrix) to a 2-dimensional space while preserving local distances between cells. In contrast with PCA, tSNE is a stochastic algorithm which means running the method multiple times on the same dataset will result in different plots. In the code below we fix the “seed” of the random-number generator so that we always get the same plot.  8.3.1 Before QC scater::plotTSNE(umi[endog_genes, ],                  ntop = 500,                  perplexity = 130,                  colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                  size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                  shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                  exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;,                  rand_seed = 123456)    Figure 8.5: tSNE map of the blischak data     8.3.2 After QC scater::plotTSNE(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                  ntop = 500,                  perplexity = 130,                  colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                  size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                  shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                  exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;,                  rand_seed = 123456)    Figure 8.6: tSNE map of the blischak data   Interpreting PCA and tSNE plots is often challenging. However, in this case it is clear that they provide a similar picture of the data. Comparing Figure 8.5 and 8.6, it is again clear that the samples from NA19098.r2 are no longer outliers after the QC filtering. Furthermore tSNE requires you to provide a value of “perplexity” which reflects the number of neighbours used to build the nearest-neighbour network; a high value creates a dense network which clumps cells together while a low value makes the network more sparse allowing groups of cells to separate from each other. scater uses a default perplexity of the total number of cells divided by five (rounded down). Exercise 2 How do the tSNE plots change when a perplexity of 10 or 200 is used? Our answer    Figure 8.7: tSNE map of the blischak data (perplexity = 10)      Figure 8.8: tSNE map of the blischak data (perplexity = 200)   If your answers are different please compare your code with ours (you need to search for this exercise in the opened file).    8.4 Big Exercise Perform the same analysis with read counts of the Blischak data.

One of the main challenges in analyzing scRNA-seq data stems from the fact that it is difficult to carry out a true technical replicate (why?) to distinguish biological and technical variability. In the previous chapters we considered batch effects and in this chapter we will continue to explore how experimental artifacts can be identified and removed. We will continue using the scater package since it provides a set of methods specifically for quality control of experimental and explanatory variables. Moreover, we will continue to work with the Blischak data that was used in the previous chapter. library(scater, quietly = TRUE) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] # after QC we could get some genes with only 0 values # we need to remove those keep_feature &lt;- rowSums(is_exprs(umi.qc)) &gt; 0 umi.qc &lt;- umi.qc[keep_feature, ] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control The umi.qc dataset contains filtered cells and genes. Our next step is to explore technical drivers of variability in the data to inform data normalisation before downstream analysis.   10.2 Correlations with PCs Let’s first look again at the PCA plot of the QCed dataset: scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;)    Figure 10.1: PCA plot of the blischak data   scater allows one to identify principle components that correlate with experimental and QC variables of interest (it ranks principle components by \\(R^2\\) from a linear model regressing PC value against the variable of interest). Let’s test whether some of the variables correlate with any of the PCs.  10.2.1 Detected genes scater::plotQC(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                type = &quot;find-pcs&quot;,                variable = &quot;total_features&quot;,                exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;)    Figure 10.2: PC correlation with the number of detected genes   Indeed, we can see that PC1 can be completely explained by the number of the detected genes. In fact, it was also visible on the PCA plot above. This is a well-known issue in scRNA-seq and was described here.    10.3 Explanatory variables scater can also compute the marginal \\(R^2\\) for each variable when fitting a linear model regressing expression values for each gene against just that variable, and display a density plot of the gene-wise marginal \\(R^2\\) values for the variables. scater::plotQC(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                type = &quot;expl&quot;,                exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;,                variables = c(&quot;total_features&quot;,                              &quot;total_counts&quot;,                              &quot;batch&quot;,                              &quot;individual&quot;,                              &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_ERCC&quot;,                              &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_MT&quot;))    Figure 10.3: Explanatory variables   This analysis indicates that the number of detected genes (again) and also the sequencing depth (number of counts) have substantial explanatory power for many genes, so these variables are good candidates for conditioning out in a normalisation step, or including in downstream statistical models. Expression of ERCCs also appears to be an important explanatory variable.   10.4 Other confounders In addition to correcting for batch, there are other factors that one may want to compensate for. As with batch correction, these adjustments require extrinsic information. One popular method is scLVM which allows you to identify and subtract the effect from processes such as cell-cycle or apoptosis. In addition, protocols may differ in terms of their coverage of each transcript, their bias based on the average content of A/T nucleotides, or their ability to capture short transcripts. Ideally, we would like to compensate for all of these differences and biases.   10.5 Exercise Perform the same analysis with read counts of the Blischak data.

This can be done by providing a design matrix to normaliseExprs(). We are not covering this topic here, but you can try to do it yourself as an exercise. Instead we will explore how simple size-factor normalisations correcting for library size can remove the effects of some of the confounders and explanatory variables.   12.2 Library size Library sizes vary because scRNA-seq data is often sequenced on highly multiplexed platforms the total reads which are derived from each cell may differ substantially. Some quantification methods (eg. Cufflinks, RSEM) incorporated library size when determining gene expression estimates thus do not require this normalization. However, if another quantification method was used then library size must be corrected for by multiplying or dividing each column of the expression matrix by a “normalization factor” which is an estimate of the library size relative to the other cells. Many methods to correct for library size have been developped for bulk RNA-seq and can be equally applied to scRNA-seq (eg. UQ, SF, CPM, RPKM, FPKM, TPM).   12.3 Normalisations The simplest way to normalize this data is to convert it to counts per million (CPM) by dividing each column by its total then multiplying by 1,000,000. Note that spike-ins should be excluded from the calculation of total expression in order to correct for total cell RNA content, therefore we will only use endogenous genes. calc_cpm &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL)  {     norm_factor &lt;- colSums(expr_mat[-spikes, ])     return(t(t(expr_mat)/norm_factor)) * 10^6 } One potential drawback of CPM is if your sample contains genes that are both very highly expressed and differentially expressed across the cells. In this case, the total molecules in the cell may depend of whether such genes are on/off in the cell and normalizing by total molecules may hide the differential expression of those genes and/or falsely create differential expression for the remaining genes. Note: RPKM, FPKM and TPM are variants on CPM which further adjust counts by the length of the respective gene/transcript. To deal with this potentiality several other measures were devised: The size factor (SF) was proposed and popularized by DESeq (Anders and Huber (2010)). First the geometric mean of each gene across all cells is calculated. The size factor for each cell is the median across genes of the ratio of the expression to the gene’s geometric mean. A draw back to this method is that since it uses the geometric mean only genes with non-zero expression values across all cells can be used in its calculation, making it unadvisable for large low-depth scRNASeq experiments. edgeR &amp; scater call this method RLE for “relative log expression”. calc_sf &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL)  {     geomeans &lt;- exp(rowMeans(log(expr_mat[-spikes, ])))     SF &lt;- function(cnts) {         median((cnts/geomeans)[(is.finite(geomeans) &amp; geomeans &gt;              0)])     }     norm_factor &lt;- apply(expr_mat[-spikes, ], 2, SF)     return(t(t(expr_mat)/norm_factor)) } The upperquartile (UQ) was proposed by Bullard et al (2010). Here each column is divided by the 75% quantile of the counts for each library. Often the calculated quantile is scaled by the median across cells to keep the absolute level of expression relatively consistent. A draw back to this method is that for low-depth scRNASeq experiments the large number of undetected genes may result in the 75% quantile being zero (or close to it). This limitation can be overcome by generalizing the idea and using a higher quantile (eg. the 99% quantile is the default in scater) or by excluding zeros prior to calculating the 75% quantile. calc_uq &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL)  {     UQ &lt;- function(x) {         quantile(x[x &gt; 0], 0.75)     }     uq &lt;- unlist(apply(expr_mat[-spikes, ], 2, UQ))     norm_factor &lt;- uq/median(uq)     return(t(t(expr_mat)/norm_factor)) } Another method is called TMM is the weighted trimmed mean of M-values (to the reference) proposed by Robinson and Oshlack (2010). The M-values in question are the gene-wise log2 fold changes between individual cells. One cell is used as the reference then the M-values for each other cell is calculated compared to this reference. These values are then trimmed by removing the top and bottom ~30%, and the average of the remaining values is calculated by weighting them to account for the effect of the log scale on variance. Each non-reference cell is multiplied by the calculated factor. Two potential issues with this method are insufficient non-zero genes left after trimming, and the assumption that most genes are not differentially expressed. We will use visual inspection of PCA plots and calculation of cell-wise relative log expression (calc_cell_RLE()) to compare the efficiency of different normalization methods. Cells with many[few] reads have higher[lower] than median expression for most genes resulting in a positive[negative] RLE across the cell, whereas normalized cells have an RLE close to zero. calc_cell_RLE &lt;- function (expr_mat, spikes = NULL)  {     RLE_gene &lt;- function(x) {         if (median(unlist(x)) &gt; 0) {             log((x + 1)/(median(unlist(x)) + 1))/log(2)         }         else {             rep(NA, times = length(x))         }     }     if (!is.null(spikes)) {         RLE_matrix &lt;- t(apply(expr_mat[-spikes, ], 1, RLE_gene))     }     else {         RLE_matrix &lt;- t(apply(expr_mat, 1, RLE_gene))     }     cell_RLE &lt;- apply(RLE_matrix, 2, median, na.rm = T)     return(cell_RLE) } Tallulah: I need to revamp this to (1) include RLE, (2) change what is/isn’t an exercise, and (3) possibly add comparison of scater/edgeR with actual functions for DESeq Tallulah: Vague plan: show RLE &amp; compare to DESeq ‘truth’ then have UQ, TMM, and CPM as exercises. Show everything for FPKMs scater acts as a wrapper for the calcNormFactors function from edgeR which implements several library size normalization methods making it easy to apply any of these methods to our data. Note: edgeR makes extra adjustments to some of the normalization methods which will result in somewhat different results than if the original methods are followed exactly, e.g. edgeR’s and scater’s “RLE” method which is based on the “size factor” used by DESeq may give different results to the estimateSizeFactorsForMatrix method in the DESeq/DESeq2 packages. In addition, some versions of edgeR will not calculate the normalization factors correctly unless lib.size is set at 1 for all cells. We will continue to work with the Blischak data that was used in the previous chapter. library(scater, quietly = TRUE) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control  12.3.1 Raw scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;counts&quot;)    Figure 12.1: PCA plot of the blischak data   boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(counts(umi.qc)),         col = &quot;grey50&quot;,         ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;,         main = &quot;&quot;)    Figure 12.2: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data     12.3.2 CPM scater performs this normalisation by default, you can control it by changing exprs_values parameter to &quot;exprs&quot;. scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;cpm&quot;)    Figure 12.3: PCA plot of the blischak data after CPM normalisation   boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(cpm(umi.qc)),         col = &quot;grey50&quot;,         ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;,         main = &quot;&quot;)    Figure 12.4: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data     12.3.3 TMM umi.qc &lt;-      scater::normaliseExprs(umi.qc,                            method = &quot;TMM&quot;,                            feature_set = endog_genes,                            lib.size = rep(1, ncol(umi.qc))) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;norm_counts&quot;)    Figure 12.5: PCA plot of the blischak data after TMM normalisation   boxplot(calc_cell_RLE(norm_counts(umi.qc)),         col = &quot;grey50&quot;,         ylab = &quot;RLE&quot;,         main = &quot;&quot;)    Figure 12.6: Cell-wise RLE of the blischak data   Exercise: Use method = &quot;RLE&quot; and method = &quot;upperquartile&quot; to perform size-factor and UQ normalizations and compare to the results above.   12.3.4 RLE umi.qc &lt;-      scater::normaliseExprs(umi.qc,                            method = &quot;RLE&quot;,                            feature_set = endog_genes,                            lib.size = rep(1, ncol(umi.qc))) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;norm_counts&quot;)    Figure 12.7: PCA plot of the blischak data after RLE normalisation     12.3.5 Upperquantile umi.qc &lt;-      scater::normaliseExprs(umi.qc,                            method = &quot;upperquartile&quot;,                             feature_set = endog_genes,                            p = 0.99,                            lib.size = rep(1, ncol(umi.qc))) scater::plotPCA(umi.qc[endog_genes, ],                 colour_by = &quot;batch&quot;,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                 shape_by = &quot;individual&quot;,                 exprs_values = &quot;norm_counts&quot;)    Figure 12.8: PCA plot of the blischak data after UQ normalisation      12.4 Other methods Some methods combine library size and fragment/gene length normalization such as:  RPKM - Reads Per Kilobase Million (for single-end sequencing) FPKM - Fragments Per Kilobase Million (same as RPKM but for paired-end sequencing, makes sure that paired ends mapped to the same fragment are not counted twice) TPM - Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (same as RPKM, but the order of normalizations is reversed - length first and sequencing depth second)  These methods are not applicable to our dataset since the end of the transcript which contains the UMI was preferentially sequenced. Furthermore in general these should only be calculated using appropriate quantification software from aligned BAM files not from read counts since often only a portion of the entire gene/transcript is sequenced, not the entire length. However, here we show how these normalisations can be calculated using scater. First, we need to find the effective transcript length in Kilobases.

Let us see whether further use of the controls (ERCC and MT) can provide us with more insights into the data. Several methods (eg. BASiCS, scLVM, RUV) have been developed for normalisation using ERCCs using different noise models and different fitting procedures. We will demonstrate some of the methods starting from the simplest one proposed by Brennecke et al., which identifies genes with significant variation above technical noise (ERCCs). library(scRNA.seq.funcs) library(RUVSeq) library(scater, quietly = TRUE) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] # after QC we could get some genes with only 0 values # we need to remove those keep_feature &lt;- rowSums(is_exprs(umi.qc)) &gt; 0 umi.qc &lt;- umi.qc[keep_feature, ] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control   14.2 Brennecke method To use the method, we first normalize for library size then calculate the mean and the square coefficient of variation (variation divided by the squared mean expression). A curve is fit for the relationship between these two variables for the ERCC spike-in (subject to just technical variation) then a chi-square test is used to find genes significantly above the curve. This has been provided for you as the Brenneck_getVariableGenes(counts, spikes) function. umi.qc &lt;-      scater::normaliseExprs(umi.qc,                            method = &quot;RLE&quot;,                            feature_set = endog_genes,                            lib.size = rep(1, ncol(umi.qc))) erccs &lt;- grep(&quot;ERCC-&quot;, rownames(assayData(umi.qc)$norm_counts)) highly.var.genes &lt;- scRNA.seq.funcs::Brennecke_getVariableGenes(             assayData(umi.qc)$norm_counts,             erccs ) ## Warning in scRNA.seq.funcs::Brennecke_getVariableGenes(assayData(umi.qc) ## $norm_counts, : Only 24 spike-ins to be used in fitting, may result in poor ## fit.

The red curve is the fitted technical noise model and the dashed line is the 95% CI. Pink dots are the genes with significant biological variability after multiple-testing correction. Since our dataset is relatively homogeneous only 326 genes are identified as significantly variable.   14.3 Remove Unwanted Variation Factors contributing to technical noise frequently appear as “batch effects” where cells processed on different days or by different technicians systematically vary from one another. Removing technical noise and correcting for batch effects can frequently be performed using the same tool or slight variants on it. We will be considering the Remove Unwanted Variation (RUV) method which uses singular value decomposition (similar to PCA) on subsets of the dataset which should be invariant (e.g. ERCC spike-ins). Then the method removes the identified unwanted factors. assayData(umi.qc)$ruv_counts &lt;- RUVSeq::RUVg(     round(assayData(umi.qc)$norm_counts),     erccs,     k = 1)$normalizedCounts   14.4 Effectiveness 1 We evaluate the effectiveness of the normalization by inspecting the PCA plot where shape corresponds the technical replicate and colour corresponds to different biological samples (individuals from whom the iPSC lines where derived).

The exact nature of the analysis depends on the dataset and the biological question at hand. Nevertheless, there are a few operations which are useful in a wide range of contexts and we will be discussing some of them. We will start with the clustering of scRNA-seq data.  16.1 Introduction One of the most promising applications of scRNA-seq is the discovery and annotation of cell-types based on the transcription profiles. Computationally, this is a hard problem as it amounts to unsupervised clustering. That is, we need to identify groups of cells based on the similarities of the transcriptomes without any prior knowledge of the labels. The problem is made more challenging due to the high level of noise and the large number of dimensions (i.e. genes).   16.2 Dimensionality reductions When working with large datasets, it can often be beneficial to apply some sort of dimensionality reduction method. By projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional sub-space, one is often able to significantly reduce the amount of noise. An additional benefit is that it is typically much easier to visualize the data in a 2 or 3-dimensional subspace. Here we will introduce some of the popular dimensionality reduction methods.  16.2.1 PCA Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses a transformation to convert a set of observations into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs). The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. PCA is defined in such a way that the first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components.    Figure 16.1: Schematic representation of PCA dimensionality reduction (taken from here)     16.2.2 Spectral Spectral decomposition is the factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In application to scRNA-seq data, the matrix can be either an input expression matrix, or matrix of distances between the cells. The computed eigenvectors are similar to the projections of the data to PCs (chapter 16.2.1).   16.2.3 tSNE    16.3 Clustering methods Unsupervised clustering is useful in many different applications and it has been widely studied in machine learning. Some of the most popular approaches are discussed below.  16.3.1 Hierarchical clustering In hierarchical clustering, one can use either a bottom-up or a top-down approach. In the former case, each cell is initially assigned to its own cluster and pairs of clusters are subsequently merged to create a hieararchy:    Figure 16.2: Raw data      Figure 16.3: The hierarchical clustering dendrogram   With a top-down strategy, one instead starts with all observations in one cluster and then recursively split each cluster to form a hierarchy. One of the advantages of this strategy is that the method is deterministic.   16.3.2 k-means In k-means clustering, the goal is to partition N cells into k different clusters. In an iterative manner, cluster centers are assigned and each cell is assigned to its nearest cluster:    Figure 16.4: Schematic representation of the k-means clustering   Most methods for scRNA-seq analysis includes a k-means step at some point.   16.3.3 Graph-based methods Over the last two decades there has been a lot of interest in analyzing networks in various domains. One goal is to identify groups or modules of nodes in a network. Some of these methods can be applied to scRNA-seq data and one example is the method, which is based on the concept of identifying groups of tightly connected nodes.    16.4 Challenges in clustering  What is the number of clusters k? Scalability: in the last 2 years the number of cells in scRNA-seq experiments has grown by 2 orders of magnitude from ~\\(10^2\\) to ~\\(10^4\\) Tools are not user-friendly    16.5 Tools for scRNA-seq data  16.5.1 SINCERA  Based on hierarchical clustering Data is converted to z-scores before clustering Identify k by finding the first singleton cluster in the hierarchy    16.5.2 pcaReduce  Based on PCA    16.5.3 SC3  Based on PCA and spectral dimensionality reductions Utilises k-means Additionally performs the consensus clustering    16.5.4 tSNE+k-means   16.5.5 SNN-Cliq    "],
